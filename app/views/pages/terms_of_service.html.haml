/           %h3 Loomio is a social enterprise collectively owned by the people building it.
/           %p Social enterprise creates social and environmental benefit in a way that generates sustainable revenue. Unlike a traditional profit-maximising company, revenue is not an end in itself, but a means towards achieving a core social purpose.
/           %p A worker-owned cooperative structure is a powerful way to live our values of collaboration and collective ownership. This legal structure embodies our commitment to democracy in the workplace and connects us to a global movement based on cooperation.

/           %p Loomio needs to remain independent to support this diversity. We will never do anything to compromise our autonomy or core purpose. We will never sell your data.

/           %p Loomio couldn’t be anything other than open-source.
/           %p Peer-production is transforming the way communities create value, laying the foundation for a new economy of abundance. Open collaboration unlocks collective wisdom on a scale we’ve never seen before, producing invaluable public resources like Wikipedia and Linux.
/           %p Free software is about the freedom of the user, not the price of the service. Groups with a budget contribute financially for the use of Loomio. This means we can gift it to groups without a budget.

If the group isn’t in love with the first proposal, anyone can suggest a better one and keep moving forward. Through this dynamic process, the collective wisdom of your group can generate better ideas than anyone would have come up with on their own.

/           %p Loomio is being built by a core team in Wellington, New Zealand, and a wider network of friends and supporters all over the world. This video is a presentation by one of the team members that explains some of the background of the project.
