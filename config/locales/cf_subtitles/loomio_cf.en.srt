Hi I’m ALANNA. I’m part of a small team of open-source developers, facilitators and activists here in New Zealand.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:12,500
We’re working on a project called Loomio.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,700
It’s a simple online tool for collaborative decision-making.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:25,000
Hi I’m RICHARD. when I got involved in the Occupy movement I experienced how massively empowering it can be when everyone’s voice is included in a decision-making process.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,400
But if it can only happen in person, it can never work at a large scale.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,200
It seems crazy, but there’s no easy way to make decisions together online.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,300
Email and social media just weren’t built for bringing online discussion to clear agreement.

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,000
It’s like this missing piece of the Internet, that we need for turning online talk into real-world action.

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,900
So that’s what we’ve been working on for the past 18 months.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:59,400
As soon as we released our prototype, we were swamped by thousands of groups around the world - from student movements and City Councils, to software projects and community groups.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
We’ve learned a lot from all the people doing great things with the prototype.

12
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,500
We know its potential, and we know its limitations.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,300
Now it’s time to build the real thing.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,800
Loomio 1.0 - a tool for truly inclusive decision-making.

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,059
At its core, it’s actually really simple:

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,000
you talk things through and hear different perspectives,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,600
build agreement and work through any concerns,

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,500
and decide a clear course of action that works for everyone.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,900
This flexible, dynamic process unlocks collective wisdom, coming to better outcomes together than any individual would have on their own.

20
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,600
Loomio 1.0 will work on all devices, opening it up to parts of the world where computers are scarce.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,200
You can host it yourself, to take complete control of your own privacy.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,540
Most importantly, it’s designed to be super easy to use and accessible, so anyone can participate.

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,500
Loomio will always be free and open-source software.

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,740
We're building public infrastructure for decision-making, held in the commons.

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:05,100
By resourcing Loomio through crowdfunding, the project can be driven by the community of people who want it to happen, not by advertisers, or people who want to sell your data.

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,400
We’ve done all the research and design, and now we  just have to build it.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:19,819
An amazing crew has come together with exactly the right skills to make this happen: a development team that’s passionate about user-centred design, coupled with group process experts with decades of facilitation experience.

28
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:26,600
To take this next step, the core team needs to dedicate all of their time to it without worrying about how they’re going to feed themselves.

29
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,400
And that’s why right now we need your help.

30
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,000
We’re embracing the gift economy and asking for your support, so we can give something amazing back to the world.

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,400
You’re not just supporting a vision, you’re getting a tool that will make a difference in your own life, in your work, and in your community.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
So it’s up to all of us.

33
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,500
Will this missing piece of the internet be developed on open platforms, for the public good?

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,000
You can help to make that decision right now, by giving to this project.
