00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:07,800
Loomio is a user-friendly online tool
for making decisions together. Here's how it works.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,400
I've got a decision I want to make with a group of people.
Using Loomio makes the process easy.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,400
I give the discussion a name and invite
 the people who need to be involved.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,000
It's really simple, they don't even need to create an account. Discussions on Loomio can be public or private.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,900
Because it's online, all kinds of people
can participate from anywhere, at any time.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:36,300
We can bring together the relevant information and build shared understanding. Anyone can propose a solution.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,600
Within a proposal time frame everyone has a chance to state their position, and briefly explain why they feel the way they do.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,300
This highlights the main points creating a summary,
so others joining in can quickly catch up.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
This participant has raised a great point that's got everyone thinking.

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,200
As new information comes to light you can change your mind.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Sometimes an early proposal failing can be a productive step, that leads to a new proposal addressing everyone's concerns.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Great ideas can come from anywhere.
No one knows what all the possibilities might be.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,500
Because you're all thinking together,
when you arrive at a decision, everyone is on board.

14
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,200
The whole group is notified of the outcome,
 so you can start taking action together.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,400
If you make lots of decisions with the same people,
Loomio can become your group's online home.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,000
It creates an archive as you go, so it's easy to see all your decisions.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,900
Thousands of people are already loving Loomio.

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,000
They're being more inclusive, and spending less time
and energy to get better outcomes

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,900
Imagine using Loomio in your workplace and in your community.

20
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,100
Loomio is, and will always be, free software and open source.

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,200
Now we're building the next version of Loomio.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
It's mobile so it will work on your phone and across all kinds of devices.

23
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,900
It's accessible to people of all abilities.

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,400
It's safe, meaning you can take control of your own data.

25
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,100
And best of all, Loomio 1.0 is really easy to use.

26
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,300
It's a whole new Loomio for truly inclusive decision-making.

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,300
And that's why right now, we need your help.

28
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,000
We're embracing the gift economy,
and crowd-funding to build Loomio 1.0.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Support us so we can give something amazing back to the world.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Loomio makes it easy to include everyone,
 so we can all make great decisions together.
