1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,500
Loomio is a simple user-friendly online tool for group collaboration.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,700
It provides a neutral and independent online space for groups to make decisions together.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,000
This is a diverse group of busy people.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,670
They don't have time for lots of meetings and email doesn't work for complex discusion with lots of people at once.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,900
Let's see how they use Loomio instead.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,600
Anyone can start a discussion on any topic,
it's simple, clear, and focused

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,800
You can include context for a well informed discussion,
and attach files, photos, documents, and links.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,700
The context can be edited like a wiki,
so it can be updated as the discussion progresses.

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,500
Group dialogue continues down the left hand side.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,200
Anyone can add information and give their perspective.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,770
This part of the process doesn't have a time limit.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,440
As more people participate, the issue is
better understood and ideas begin to emerge.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,500
When a potential solution surfaces
anyone can start a proposal, which has a clear time limit.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,500
Decision-making happens on the right hand side.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,300
When people state their position they're
prompted to give a one-sentence summary explaining their decision.

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,400
This makes it easy to see why people feel the way
they do and highlights the main points.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,500
People coming into the discussion later can quickly catch up.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,799
It's easy to see what's being discussed and how the group feels.

19
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,000
People can set their own time commitment
and level of engagement, while still keeping in the loop.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
If you have a serious concern you can use the red flag option.

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,700
You can change your mind about your position as
new information comes to light.

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,100
People come to understand things they
might not have thought of at first.

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,300
You can at-mention specific people to notify them.

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:39,000
Sometimes an early proposal failing can be a productive step that leads to a new proposal addressing everyone's concerns -

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,649
it's easy to hone in on the sticking
points and bring out the important aspects of the issue.

26
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,909
Loomio automatically creates an archive as you go.

27
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,000
If you ever need to refer to past decision
it's really clear to see how it came about.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,860
The group converges on a solution that works for everyone.

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:03,300
This flexible, dynamic process unlocks collective wisdom, coming to better outcomes together than any individual would have come up with on their own.

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,300
Everyone feels heard and really high quality decisions can be reached.

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,500
When a proposal succeeds, there's a
strong shared understanding and agreement in the group already.

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,200
You can specify a clear outcome for everyone to see.

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,000
The Loomio dashboard shows all your open decisions and
you can see how they're going at a glance.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,100
It's easy to search for past discussions or start a new one.

35
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,500
Loomio helps groups make great decisions together, increasing efficiency and engagement.

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,000
