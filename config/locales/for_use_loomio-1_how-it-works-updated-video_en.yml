      Loomio is a user-friendly online tool
      for making decisions together. Here's how it works.
    t2: |
      I've got a decision I want to make with a group of people.
      Using Loomio makes the process easy.
    t3: |
      I give the discussion a name and invite
       the people who need to be involved.
    t4: |
      It's really simple, they don't even need to create an account. Discussions on Loomio can be public or private.
    t5: |
      Because it's online, all kinds of people
      can participate from anywhere, at any time.
    t6: |
      We can bring together the relevant information and build shared understanding. Anyone can propose a solution.
    t7: |
      Within a proposal time frame everyone has a chance to state their position, and briefly explain why they feel the way they do.
    t8: |
      This highlights the main points creating a summary,
      so others joining in can quickly catch up.
    t9: |
      This participant has raised a great point that's got everyone thinking.
    t10: |
      As new information comes to light you can change your mind.
    t11: |
      Sometimes an early proposal failing can be a productive step, that leads to a new proposal addressing everyone's concerns.
    t12: |
      Great ideas can come from anywhere.
      No one knows what all the possibilities might be.
    t13: |
      Because you're all thinking together,
      when you arrive at a decision, everyone is on board.
    t14: |
      The whole group is notified of the outcome,
       so you can start taking action together.
    t15: |
      If you make lots of decisions with the same people,
      Loomio can become your group's online home.
    t16: |
      It creates an archive as you go, so it's easy to see all your decisions.
    t17: |
      Thousands of people are already loving Loomio.
    t18: |
      They're being more inclusive, and spending less time
      and energy to get better outcomes
    t19: |
      Imagine using Loomio in your workplace and in your community.
    t20: |
      Loomio is, and will always be, free software and open source.
    t21: |
      Now we're building the next version of Loomio.
    t22: |
      It's mobile so it will work on your phone and across all kinds of devices.
    t23: |
      It's accessible to people of all abilities.
    t24: |
      It's safe, meaning you can take control of your own data.
    t25: |
      And best of all, Loomio 1.0 is really easy to use.
    t26: |
      It's a whole new Loomio for truly inclusive decision-making.
    t27: |
      And that's why right now, we need your help.
    t28: |
      We're embracing the gift economy,
      and crowd-funding to build Loomio 1.0.

    t30: |

       so we can all make great decisions together.
